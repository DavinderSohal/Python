# Print Patterns
# Placing one loop inside the body of another loop is called nesting. When you "nest" two loops, the outer loop takes
# control of the number of complete repetitions of the inner loop.
# Write the code that will generate the output as shown below:
#     -Ask the user, how many lines this triangle must contain. (1 to n lines)
#     -The display pattern must respect the pattern below.
#
# How the program should interact with the user: ïƒ¨
#
#               How many lines? 8
#
#               ***************
#                *************
#                 ***********
#                  *********
#                   *******
#                    *****
#                     ***
#                      *
